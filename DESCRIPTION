Description: This package holds the implementation of the data-driven framework "Automatic Location of Disparities (ALD)" which aims at locating (unfair) disparities in machine learning. ALD is
    - applicable directly on datasets (e.g., logged data from machine learning classifiers)
    - operates on different definitions of disparities (statistical parity or equalized odds)
    - deals with both categorical and continuous predictors
    - is suitable to handle high-dimensional settings
    - can identify disparities due to intersectionality where disparities arise from complex and multi-way interactions (e.g., age above 60 and female).
